# ðŸ§  Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning projects.  
This repository is a collection of practical case studies, experiments, and end-to-end projects designed to explore different aspects of data-driven solutions: from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation and deployment.

Each folder in this repository contains one standalone project, complete with code, documentation, and datasets.


## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- project-name-1/
  - data/       # Raw data
  - notebooks/  # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
  - src/        # Source code (scripts, models, utilities)
  - outputs/    # Model outputs, plots, or reports
  - README.md   # Project-specific documentation
- README.md     # Main repository README

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Apply **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** techniques to real-world problems.  
- Demonstrate end-to-end workflows, from **data collection** to **model interpretation**.  
- Build a portfolio that showcases technical and analytical skills using mostly **Python** and **SQL**.

## ðŸ§© Project List

| Project | Description | Key Topics |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| [Startup Shutdown](./project-name-1) | Predicting startup failure using Logistic Regression | Machine Learning, Logistic Regression |

*(This section will be updated as new projects are added.)*
